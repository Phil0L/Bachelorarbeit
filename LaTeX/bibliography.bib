  abstract="Manual Business Process Modeling can be a time-consuming and error-prone process, resulting in low-quality models. Therefore, various approaches have been proposed in research and practice to partially or fully automate the creation of business process models. We conducted a systematic literature review (LR) on automatic generation of business process models. The LR demonstrates that there exist various approaches for automated generation of business process models, which differ in terms of the input data, generation methods, and modeling languages utilized. Despite active research into automatic model generation, there is still considerable scope for improvement. New technologies are continually being developed to support automatic model generation. Additionally, the increasing digitalization of processes and organizations generates vast amounts of data that can be harnessed for modeling.",

  abstract = {The automatic generation of BPMN models from textual descriptions remains a major challenge, particularly when dealing with long and complex texts. Traditional natural language processing (NLP) approaches struggle with linguistic disambiguation, often resulting in incorrect BPMN models characterized by overloaded or missing relevant process elements. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, while effective at capturing semantic nuances, tend to omit key elements required for complete modeling. The objective of this study is to improve the quality of automatically generated BPMN models from textual descriptions by overcoming the respective limitations of traditional approaches and GPT-4. To this end, we propose a prompt-guided fusion method that combines a literature-based NLP approach with the reasoning capabilities of GPT-4. This fusion helps reduce the overload of activities and exclusive gateways, particularly for the NLP approach, while partially correcting errors related to the generation of parallel gateways for both approaches.},

@techreport{schneid2021data,
  abstract = {Process-Driven Applications (PDA) combine Business Process Management and less-code approaches. They are typically based on executable process models, human tasks, and adapter code to external software services. Process data is shared across these artifacts, managed by a process engine. Therefore process engineers and programmers must ensure the correct data flow within these components, but also in between. However, previous approaches have only considered the data-flow analysis of those components separately. This paper provides a concept for detecting data-flow anomalies in BPMN-based Process-Driven Applications across all artifacts. The main idea is to create a single Data-Flow Analysis (DFA) graph based on the process model's abstract syntax. Call graphs representing the internal flows of the referenced source code are transformed and merged into the DFA graph. Then, the resulting graph is extended by labels indicating data-object operations occurring at its nodes. Eventually, a combined forward and backward analysis is performed to uncover data-flow anomalies as indicators of potential errors. The analysis concept was implemented as a prototype designed for the Camunda BPM Framework, proving its practicality in several case studies.},

  abstract = {BPMN collaboration models are commonly used to describe the behaviour and interactions of processes in an inter-organisational context. An important role in this kind of models is played both by the message flow, and by sub-processes. The interplay between these features of BPMN models can conceal subtle or unexpected effects, which makes the design activity error-prone, thus leading to the possible inclusion of incorrect behaviour. In this paper, we face this problem by providing a framework for checking the correctness of BPMN models. In particular we are interested on collaboration models that include message exchange and/or sub-processes, and with a special focus on properties well-established in the business process domain, namely safeness and soundness. To enable such a verification, we have (i) defined an operational semantics for BPMN collaborations, (ii) formalised safeness and soundness properties, and a new relaxed version of soundness for detecting situations where asynchronous messages are not handled correctly by the receiver, (iii) applied the related checks on state-space representations (i.e., labelled transition systems) of collaborations, and (iv) implemented the overall formal framework that has been also integrated in the Camunda modelling environment. The resulting verification framework and tool, named S3, have been validated in relation to its effectiveness, efficiency and usability, both by using models available on a publicly accessible repository, and by carrying out experiments with a group of designers.}

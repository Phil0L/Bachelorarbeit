The Evanstonian is an upscale independent hotel. When a guest calls room service at The Evanstonian, 
the room-service manager takes down the order. She then submits an order ticket to the kitchen to 
begin preparing the food. She also gives an order to the sommelier (i.e., the wine waiter) to fetch 
wine from the cellar and to prepare any other alcoholic beverages. Eighty percent of room-service 
orders include wine or some other alcoholic beverage. Finally, she assigns the order to the waiter. 
While the kitchen and the sommelier are doing their tasks, the waiter readies a cart (i.e., puts a 
tablecloth on the cart and gathers silverware). The waiter is also responsible for nonalcoholic 
drinks. Once the food, wine, and cart are ready, the waiter delivers it to the guest` s room. After 
returning to the room-service station, the waiter debits the guest` s account. The waiter may wait 
to do the billing if he has another order to prepare or deliver.
